# lerna-symlink-demo
This repo is a simple demo of local dev with lerna monorepo and some additional project (like next js project)

To run the demo, including fetching dependencies, building all the monorepo packages, linking them to the built in nextjs demo consumer app, and starting the next js app on dev, run '''./setup.sh''' from root. To do the same but simply prepare the links for another consumer apps, run '''./link.sh'''.
